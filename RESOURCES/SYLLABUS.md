We create several GraphQL Servers, each time implementing new features.

## PART-01

Exploration of GraphQL concepts to make CRUD GraphQL Server with HTML client requests. This can also be used as a wrapper around existing REST APIs enabling a gradual transition to GraphQL.

## PART-02

With another GraphQL Server, we add in some new features leading to PART-03. We connect to other APIs to enable our GraphQL Server to act as a central API point.

## PART-03

We refactor the previous Server and start to use Schema Merging and code refactoring to enable greater modularity to our code.

## PART-04

We move on to more advanced topics:

-  More work on the resolver chain.
-  Unions, Interfaces, Enums and Custom Scalar types.
-  Error handling and formatting.
-  Authentication and Authorization techniques.
-  Subscriptions.
-  Custom directives.
-  Caching.
-  Security, DDOS.

We use JavaScript minimally and the GraphQL concepts taught are transferrable to any code base.
